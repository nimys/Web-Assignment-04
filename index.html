		<h1>Implementing jLayout & Lightbox</h1>
		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
		
				<p>The jLayout plugin makes it easy to develop a two-column layout like this one (without using CSS)! This plugin also provides for 
				many other layouts. Check them out <a href="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/jquery-plugin.html">here</a>! There are a
				huge variety of different layouts to use.</p>
				<p>The drawback?</p>
				<p>Getting comfortable and learning the functionality of jLayout. If you're already experienced with CSS, that still may
					be the better way for you to go.</p>

				<p>The Lightbox plugin can be used to open a large version of a thumbnail image. You can set this up for a single image or a
					set of images. It's a great way to showcase an online portfolio.</p>
